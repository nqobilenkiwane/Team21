## Usage Guide

### For Users:

#### Accessing Diagnostic Tool:
1. **From Dashboard**: Click "ðŸ©º AI Diagnostic Tool" in Quick Actions
2. **Direct Navigation**: Go to `/diagnostic`

#### Using the Diagnostic:
1. **Add Symptoms**:
   - Enter symptom description
   - Select severity (mild, moderate, severe)
   - Choose duration
   - Click "Add Symptom"

2. **Manage Symptoms**:
   - View added symptoms in the list
   - Remove symptoms with the âœ• button
   - Add multiple symptoms for comprehensive analysis

3. **Get AI Diagnosis**:
   - Click "ðŸ¤– Generate AI Diagnosis"

#### Alert Interpretation:
- **Green (Success)**: Operations completed successfully
- **Yellow (Warning)**: Cautions, recommendations
- **Red (Error)**: Critical issues, immediate action needed
- **Blue (Info)**: General information, features

### For Developers:

#### API Integration:
The diagnostic tool integrates with these API endpoints:
- `POST /health/ai-diagnosis` - Get AI health analysis
- `POST /health/symptoms` - Save symptoms to backend
- `GET /health/symptoms` - Retrieve user symptoms

#### Alert System Implementation:
```javascript
// Add alert
addAlert('Message text', 'success|warning|error|info');

// Remove specific alert
removeAlert(alertId);

// Alert object structure
{
  id: timestamp,
  message: 'Alert text',
  type: 'success|warning|error|info',
  timestamp: ISO string
}
```

#### Customization Options:
- **Alert Duration**: Modify auto-dismiss timeout
- **Display Limit**: Change maximum visible alerts
- **Styling**: Update alert colors and positioning
- **Priority Logic**: Customize urgency classification

## Backend Requirements

### Enhanced AI Diagnosis Endpoint:
```json
POST /health/ai-diagnosis
{
  "symptoms": ["symptom1", "symptom2", ...]
}

Response:
{
  "message": "AI analysis text",
  "recommendations": ["rec1", "rec2", ...],
  "urgency": "low|medium|high"
}
```

### Symptom Storage:
```json
POST /health/symptoms
{
  "symptom": "description",
  "severity": "mild|moderate|severe",
  "duration": "duration string",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD"
}
```

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: All diagnostic features require valid login
- **Data Privacy**: Symptom data is user-specific and secured
- **API Security**: All requests include authentication tokens
- **Input Validation**: Symptom inputs are validated and sanitized

## Testing Checklist

- **Navigation Issues**: Ensure React Router is properly configured
- **Authentication Errors**: Check token validity and storage

### Debug Mode:
Enable debug logging by setting:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true');
```

The diagnostic and alert system is now fully integrated and ready for comprehensive health monitoring and user engagement!
